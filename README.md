# 🚗 Car Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning to build a regression model that predicts the selling price of cars based on key features like mileage, engine size, fuel type, and car brand.

## 📂 Project Overview

The goal is to provide a reliable model that can assist users (e.g., car sellers, buyers, dealerships) in estimating the fair market value of a used car.

## 🔍 Features Used

- Car Brand
- Year of Manufacture
- Mileage
- Engine Size
- Transmission Type
- Fuel Type
- Location

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest
5. Model Evaluation (RMSE, R² Score)
6. Prediction & Visualization

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repo
2. Open `Car_Price_Pred.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run cells step-by-step to train and evaluate the model

## 🤝 Contributions

Contributions, feedback, and ideas are welcome to help improve the model and extend it to more real-world datasets.
